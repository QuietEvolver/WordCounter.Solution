# WordCounter!

#### _C#, .NET: WordCounter!, 9/27/2019_

## Description
Write a program that gathers both a word and sentence from a user, then checks how frequently the word appears in the sentence. It should check for full word matches only. (For instance, if provided the word "cat" and sentence "I'm walking to the cathedral." the first three letters of the word cathedral would not be counted.) Also, do not use regular expressions in your logic.

## Use Case(s)
* Gather an input word | I: "test" | O: N/A
* Gather an input sentence | I: "This is a test." | O: N/A
* Show user the frequency of their original inputted word, full word only, against the inputted sentence: | I: "test" | O: N/A* Gather an input word | I: "test" | O: N/A
