# WordCounter!

#### _C#, .NET: WordCounter!, 9/27/2019_

## Description
Write a program that gathers both a word and sentence from a user, then checks how frequently the word appears in the sentence. It should check for full word matches only. (For instance, if provided the word "cat" and sentence "I'm walking to the cathedral." the first three letters of the word cathedral would not be counted.) Also, do not use regular expressions in your logic.

## Use Case(s)
* Gather an input word; *('input' chosen as a word due to being functionally descriptive) | Input: "input" | Output: N/A
* Gather an input sentence ('This is a input sentence.' chosen for functionally descriptive  nature) | Input: "This is a input sentence." | Output: N/A
* Show user the frequency of their original inputted word, full word only, against the inputted sentence and return the frequency's number: | Input: "test"(Word); Output: N/A Input: "This is testing a test."(Sentence) | Output: "1"
